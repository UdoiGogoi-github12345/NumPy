# NumPy tutorials

_For the rendered tutorials, see https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/._

The goal of this repository is to provide high-quality resources by the
NumPy project, both for self-learning and for teaching classes with. If you're
interested in adding your own content, check the [Contributing](#contributing)
section. This set of tutorials and educational materials is not a part of the
NumPy source tree.


### Why Jupyter Notebooks?

The choice of Jupyter Notebook in this repo instead of the usual format
([reStructuredText, through Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html))
used in the main NumPy documentation has two reasons:

 * Jupyter notebooks are a common format for communicating scientific
   information.
 * Jupyter notebooks can be launched in [Binder](https://www.mybinder.org), so that users can interact
   with tutorials
 * rST may present a barrier for some people who might otherwise be very
   interested in contributing tutorial material.

#### Create an issue

Go to [https://github.com/UdoiGogoi-github12345/NumPy](https://github.com/UdoiGogoi-github12345/NumPy)
and create a new issue with your proposal. Give as much detail as you can about
what kind of content you would like to write (tutorial, how-to) and what you
plan to cover. We will try to respond as quickly as possible with comments, if
applicable.
